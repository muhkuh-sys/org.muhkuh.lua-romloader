Change log/Release notes
=========================

V 2.4.9
=======

Changes affecting openOCD and JTAG configurations:

* Update the openOCD library to v0.10.0.7: J-Link support and some speed increase.
* Enable support for the Segger J-Link JTAG adapter.
* Add Support for the NXEB 90-SPE board.
* Change the interface name of the NXHX90-DRIVE to NXHX90-MC.
* Fix a spike on the reset line that occurred on the nSRST line on FTDI-based 
  JTAG adapters when a reset was triggered.
  This change affects the following boards:
  NXHX 90-JTAG, NXHX 90-MC, NXHX 90-SPE, NRPEB H90-RE
  and the following adapters:
  NXJTAG-USB and NXJTAG-4000-USB

V 2.4.8
=======

* Add the onboard USB-JTAG interface of the NXHX 90-DRIVE board (VID 0x1939 PID 0x0031).

V 2.4.7
=======

* Romloader_test assumes that all messages up to 2048 bytes are transmitted 
  in full, not split into multiple messages.
* Romloader_test includes the chip type and plugin/interface name in the test 
  result. 
* Define max. frequencies for the JTAG adapter and the CPU, and set the adapter 
  speed to the minimum of the two at the end of chip init. 
  Generally, the JTAG speed (adapter_khz) is set to 6 MHz. 
  When the netIOL is accessed, it is set to 1 MHz. 
  When the onboard JTAG port of the NXHX boards with the FT2232D or the 
  Amontec JTAGkey mini is used, it is set to 2 MHz.
  
V 2.4.6
=======

* JTAG: Set the adapter speed to 6 MHz at the end of chip_init; 1 MHz for netIOL.
* Romloader test: Catch errors during the test (wrap in xpcall) and print OK/Error at the end.

V 2.4.5
=======

* Fix DCC messaging on netx 90.
* Fix chip type detection of netx 10.
* Improved reset handling on netx 90, when SRST is not present/not connected.
  If _USE_SOFT_RESET_ in jtag_detect_init.tcl is false (default), use SRST (hardware reset).
  If _USE_SOFT_RESET_ is true, use sysresetreq (via JTAG).
* Build DCC output code for netx 4000 (preliminary).
* Romloader Test:
  Move montest binary for netx 4000 to 0x04004000 to prevent overwriting UART monitor.  

V 2.4.4
=======

* Add FTDI-JTAG interface "NRPEB H90-RE".

V 2.4.3
========

* Merge v2.4.1 and v2.4.2.

V 2.4.2
========

* Fix the chip type detection on the netX 90 MPW, Rev. 0 and Rev. 1 when
  using the serial or ethernet console mode.

V 2.4.1
========

* Support JTAG on the netIOL MPW.
* Fix structure packing (caused errors in Windows builds)
* Change the name string for the netX90 Rev. 0 from "netX90" to "netX90 Rev0".
